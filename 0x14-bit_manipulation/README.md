## Learning Objectives
*At the end of this project, i am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:*

### General
- Look for the right source of information without too much help
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
<h1>Tasks</h1>
0. a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1. a function that prints the binary of a number without using / or %
2. a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
3. a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4. a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5. a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
6. a function that checks for big endian and little endian
